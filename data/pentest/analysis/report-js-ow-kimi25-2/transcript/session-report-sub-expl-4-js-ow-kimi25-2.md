_Thinking:_

 The user wants me to test for File Upload and Path Traversal vulnerabilities in OWASP Juice Shop. Let me start by:

1. Loading the scan mode skill
2. Getting the evidence directory
3. Testing the various attack vectors

Let me begin by loading the necessary skills and getting the evidence directory.

 I'll start by loading the necessary skills and getting the evidence directory for this security test.

# Skill: scanmode-standard

# Standard Testing Mode

Balanced security assessment with structured methodology. Thorough coverage without exhaustive depth.

## Approach

Systematic testing across the full attack surface. Understand the application before exploiting it.

## Phase 1: Reconnaissance

**Whitebox (source available)**
- Map codebase structure: modules, entry points, routing
- Identify architecture pattern (MVC, microservices, monolith)
- Trace input vectors: forms, APIs, file uploads, headers, cookies
- Review authentication and authorization flows
- Analyze database interactions and ORM usage
- Check dependencies for known CVEs
- Understand the data model and sensitive data locations

**Blackbox (no source)**
- Crawl application thoroughly, interact with every feature
- Enumerate endpoints, parameters, and functionality
- Fingerprint technology stack
- Map user roles and access levels
- Capture traffic with proxy to understand request/response patterns

## Phase 2: Business Logic Analysis

Before testing for vulnerabilities, understand the application:

- **Critical flows** - payments, registration, data access, admin functions
- **Role boundaries** - what actions are restricted to which users
- **Data access rules** - what data should be isolated between users
- **State transitions** - order lifecycle, account status changes
- **Trust boundaries** - where does privilege or sensitive data flow

## Phase 3: Systematic Testing

Test each attack surface methodically. Spawn focused subagents for different areas.

**Input Validation**
- Injection testing on all input fields (SQL, XSS, command, template)
- File upload bypass attempts
- Search and filter parameter manipulation
- Redirect and URL parameter handling

**Authentication & Session**
- Brute force protection
- Session token entropy and handling
- Password reset flow analysis
- Logout session invalidation
- Authentication bypass techniques

**Access Control**
- Horizontal: user A accessing user B's resources
- Vertical: unprivileged user accessing admin functions
- API endpoints vs UI access control consistency
- Direct object reference manipulation

**Business Logic**
- Multi-step process bypass (skip steps, reorder)
- Race conditions on state-changing operations
- Boundary conditions: negative values, zero, extremes
- Transaction replay and manipulation

## Phase 4: Exploitation

- Every finding requires a working proof-of-concept
- Demonstrate actual impact, not theoretical risk
- Chain vulnerabilities to show maximum severity
- Document full attack path from entry to impact
- Use python tool for complex exploit development

## Phase 5: Reporting

- Document all confirmed vulnerabilities with reproduction steps
- Severity based on exploitability and business impact
- Remediation recommendations
- Note areas requiring further investigation

## Chaining

Always ask: "If I can do X, what does that enable next?" Keep pivoting until reaching maximum privilege or data exposure.

Prefer complete end-to-end paths (entry point → pivot → privileged action/data) over isolated findings. Use the application as a real user would—exploit must survive actual workflow and state transitions.

When you discover a useful pivot (info leak, weak boundary, partial access), immediately pursue the next step rather than stopping at the first win.

## Mindset

Methodical and systematic. Document as you go. Validate everything—no assumptions about exploitability. Think about business impact, not just technical severity.

# Skill: vuln-insecure-file-uploads

# Insecure File Uploads

Upload surfaces are high risk: server-side execution (RCE), stored XSS, malware distribution, storage takeover, and DoS. Modern stacks mix direct-to-cloud uploads, background processors, and CDNs—authorization and validation must hold across every step.

## Attack Surface

- Web/mobile/API uploads, direct-to-cloud (S3/GCS/Azure) presigned flows, resumable/multipart protocols (tus, S3 MPU)
- Image/document/media pipelines (ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick, Ghostscript, ExifTool, PDF engines, office converters)
- Admin/bulk importers, archive uploads (zip/tar), report/template uploads, rich text with attachments
- Serving paths: app directly, object storage, CDN, email attachments, previews/thumbnails

## Reconnaissance

### Surface Map

- Endpoints/fields: upload, file, avatar, image, attachment, import, media, document, template
- Direct-to-cloud params: key, bucket, acl, Content-Type, Content-Disposition, x-amz-meta-*, cache-control
- Resumable APIs: create/init → upload/chunk → complete/finalize; check if metadata/headers can be altered late
- Background processors: thumbnails, PDF→image, virus scan queues; identify timing and status transitions

### Capability Probes

- Small probe files of each claimed type; diff resulting Content-Type, Content-Disposition, and X-Content-Type-Options on download
- Magic bytes vs extension: JPEG/GIF/PNG headers; mismatches reveal reliance on extension or MIME sniffing
- SVG/HTML probe: do they render inline (text/html or image/svg+xml) or download (attachment)?
- Archive probe: simple zip with nested path traversal entries and symlinks to detect extraction rules

## Detection Channels

### Server Execution

- Web shell execution (language dependent), config/handler uploads (.htaccess, .user.ini, web.config) enabling execution
- Interpreter-side template/script evaluation during conversion (ImageMagick/Ghostscript/ExifTool)

### Client Execution

- Stored XSS via SVG/HTML/JS if served inline without correct headers; PDF JavaScript; office macros in previewers

### Header and Render

- Missing X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff enabling browser sniff to script
- Content-Type reflection from upload vs server-set; Content-Disposition: inline vs attachment

### Process Side Effects

- AV/CDR race or absence; background job status allows access before scan completes; password-protected archives bypass scanning

## Core Payloads

### Web Shells and Configs

- PHP: GIF polyglot (starts with GIF89a) followed by `<?php echo 1; ?>`; place where PHP is executed
- .htaccess to map extensions to code (AddType/AddHandler); .user.ini (auto_prepend/append_file) for PHP-FPM
- ASP/JSP equivalents where supported; IIS web.config to enable script execution

### Stored XSS

- SVG with onload/onerror handlers served as image/svg+xml or text/html
- HTML file with script when served as text/html or sniffed due to missing nosniff

### MIME Magic Polyglots

- Double extensions: avatar.jpg.php, report.pdf.html; mixed casing: .pHp, .PhAr
- Magic-byte spoofing: valid JPEG header then embedded script; verify server uses content inspection, not extensions alone

### Archive Attacks

- Zip Slip: entries with `../../` to escape extraction dir; symlink-in-zip pointing outside target; nested zips
- Zip bomb: extreme compression ratios to exhaust resources in processors

### Toolchain Exploits

- ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick legacy vectors (policy.xml may mitigate): crafted SVG/PS/EPS invoking external commands or reading files
- Ghostscript in PDF/PS with file operators (%pipe%)
- ExifTool metadata parsing bugs; overly large or crafted EXIF/IPTC/XMP fields

### Cloud Storage Vectors

- S3/GCS presigned uploads: attacker controls Content-Type/Disposition; set text/html or image/svg+xml and inline rendering
- Public-read ACL or permissive bucket policies expose uploads broadly
- Object key injection via user-controlled path prefixes
- Signed URL reuse and stale URLs; serving directly from bucket without attachment + nosniff headers

## Advanced Techniques

### Resumable Multipart

- Change metadata between init and complete (e.g., swap Content-Type/Disposition at finalize)
- Upload benign chunks, then swap last chunk or complete with different source

### Filename and Path

- Unicode homoglyphs, trailing dots/spaces, device names, reserved characters to bypass validators
- Null-byte truncation on legacy stacks; overlong paths; case-insensitive collisions overwriting existing files

### Processing Races

- Request file immediately after upload but before AV/CDR completes
- Trigger heavy conversions (large images, deep PDFs) to widen race windows

### Metadata Abuse

- Oversized EXIF/XMP/IPTC blocks to trigger parser flaws
- Payloads in document properties of Office/PDF rendered by previewers

### Header Manipulation

- Force inline rendering with Content-Type + inline Content-Disposition
- Cache poisoning via CDN with keys missing Vary on Content-Type/Disposition

## Bypass Techniques

### Validation Gaps

- Client-side only checks; relying on JS/MIME provided by browser
- Trusting multipart boundary part headers blindly
- Extension allowlists without server-side content inspection

### Evasion Tricks

- Double extensions, mixed case, hidden dotfiles, extra dots (file..png), long paths with allowed suffix
- Multipart name vs filename vs path discrepancies; duplicate parameters and late parameter precedence

## Special Contexts

### Rich Text Editors

- RTEs allow image/attachment uploads and embed links; verify sanitization and serving headers

### Mobile Clients

- Mobile SDKs may send nonstandard MIME or metadata; servers sometimes trust client-side transformations

### Serverless and CDN

- Direct-to-bucket uploads with Lambda/Workers post-processing; verify security decisions are not delegated to frontends
- CDN caching of uploaded content; ensure correct cache keys and headers

## Testing Methodology

1. **Map the pipeline** - Client → ingress → storage → processors → serving. Note where validation and auth occur
2. **Identify allowed types** - Size limits, filename rules, storage keys, and who serves the content
3. **Collect baselines** - Capture resulting URLs and headers for legitimate uploads
4. **Exercise bypass families** - Extension games, MIME/content-type, magic bytes, polyglots, metadata payloads, archive structure
5. **Validate execution** - Can uploaded content execute on server or client?

## Validation

1. Demonstrate execution or rendering of active content: web shell reachable, or SVG/HTML executing JS when viewed
2. Show filter bypass: upload accepted despite restrictions with evidence on retrieval
3. Prove header weaknesses: inline rendering without nosniff or missing attachment
4. Show race or pipeline gap: access before AV/CDR; extraction outside intended directory
5. Provide reproducible steps: request/response for upload and subsequent access

## False Positives

- Upload stored but never served back; or always served as attachment with strict nosniff
- Converters run in locked-down sandboxes with no external IO and no script engines
- AV/CDR blocks the payload and quarantines; access before scan is impossible by design

## Impact

- Remote code execution on application stack or media toolchain host
- Persistent cross-site scripting and session/token exfiltration via served uploads
- Malware distribution via public storage/CDN; brand/reputation damage
- Data loss or corruption via overwrite/zip slip; service degradation via zip bombs

## Pro Tips

1. Keep PoCs minimal: tiny SVG/HTML for XSS, a single-line PHP/ASP where relevant
2. Always capture download response headers and final MIME; that decides browser behavior
3. Prefer transforming risky formats to safe renderings (SVG→PNG) rather than complex sanitization
4. In presigned flows, constrain all headers and object keys server-side
5. For archives, extract in a chroot/jail with explicit allowlist; drop symlinks and reject traversal
6. Test finalize/complete steps in resumable flows; many validations only run on init
7. Verify background processors with EICAR and tiny polyglots
8. When you cannot get execution, aim for stored XSS or header-driven script execution
9. Validate that CDNs honor attachment/nosniff
10. Document full pipeline behavior per asset type

## Summary

Secure uploads are a pipeline property. Enforce strict type, size, and header controls; transform or strip active content; never execute or inline-render untrusted uploads; and keep storage private with controlled, signed access.

# Skill: vuln-path-traversal-lfi-rfi

# Path Traversal / LFI / RFI

Improper file path handling and dynamic inclusion enable sensitive file disclosure, config/source leakage, SSRF pivots, and code execution. Treat all user-influenced paths, names, and schemes as untrusted; normalize and bind them to an allowlist or eliminate user control entirely.

## Attack Surface

**Path Traversal**
- Read files outside intended roots via `../`, encoding, normalization gaps

**Local File Inclusion (LFI)**
- Include server-side files into interpreters/templates

**Remote File Inclusion (RFI)**
- Include remote resources (HTTP/FTP/wrappers) for code execution

**Archive Extraction**
- Zip Slip: write outside target directory upon unzip/untar

**Normalization Mismatches**
- Server/proxy differences (nginx alias/root, upstream decoders)
- OS-specific paths: Windows separators, device names, UNC, NT paths, alternate data streams

## High-Value Targets

**Unix**
- `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/hosts`, application `.env`/`config.yaml`
- SSH keys, cloud creds, service configs/logs

**Windows**
- `C:\Windows\win.ini`, IIS/web.config, programdata configs, application logs

**Application**
- Source code templates and server-side includes
- Secrets in env dumps, framework caches

## Reconnaissance

### Surface Map

- HTTP params: `file`, `path`, `template`, `include`, `page`, `view`, `download`, `export`, `report`, `log`, `dir`, `theme`, `lang`
- Upload and conversion pipelines: image/PDF renderers, thumbnailers, office converters
- Archive extract endpoints and background jobs; imports with ZIP/TAR/GZ/7z
- Server-side template rendering (PHP/Smarty/Twig/Blade), email templates, CMS themes/plugins
- Reverse proxies and static file servers (nginx, CDN) in front of app handlers

### Capability Probes

- Path traversal baseline: `../../etc/hosts` and `C:\Windows\win.ini`
- Encodings: `%2e%2e%2f`, `%252e%252e%252f`, `..%2f`, `..%5c`, mixed UTF-8 (`%c0%2e`), Unicode dots and slashes
- Normalization tests: `..../`, `..\\`, `././`, trailing dot/double dot segments; repeated decoding
- Absolute path acceptance: `/etc/passwd`, `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
- Server mismatch: `/static/..;/../etc/passwd` ("..;"), encoded slashes (`%2F`), double-decoding via upstream

## Detection Channels

### Direct

- Response body discloses file content (text, binary, base64)
- Error pages echo real paths

### Error-Based

- Exception messages expose canonicalized paths or `include()` warnings with real filesystem locations

### OAST

- RFI/LFI with wrappers that trigger outbound fetches (HTTP/DNS) to confirm inclusion/execution

### Side Effects

- Archive extraction writes files unexpectedly outside target
- Verify with directory listings or follow-up reads

## Key Vulnerabilities

### Path Traversal Bypasses

**Encodings**
- Single/double URL-encoding, mixed case, overlong UTF-8, UTF-16, path normalization oddities

**Mixed Separators**
- `/` and `\\` on Windows; `//` and `\\\\` collapse differences across frameworks

**Dot Tricks**
- `....//` (double dot folding), trailing dots (Windows), trailing slashes, appended valid extension

**Absolute Path Injection**
- Bypass joins by supplying a rooted path

**Alias/Root Mismatch**
- nginx alias without trailing slash with nested location allows `../` to escape
- Try `/static/../etc/passwd` and ";" variants (`..;`)

**Upstream vs Backend Decoding**
- Proxies/CDNs decoding `%2f` differently; test double-decoding and encoded dots

### LFI Wrappers and Techniques

**PHP Wrappers**
- `php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php` (read source)
- `zip://archive.zip#file.txt`
- `data://text/plain;base64`
- `expect://` (if enabled)

**Log/Session Poisoning**
- Inject PHP/templating payloads into access/error logs or session files then include them

**Upload Temp Names**
- Include temporary upload files before relocation; race with scanners

**Proc and Caches**
- `/proc/self/environ` and framework-specific caches for readable secrets

**Legacy Tricks**
- Null-byte (`%00`) truncation in older stacks; path length truncation

### Template Engines

- PHP include/require; Smarty/Twig/Blade with dynamic template names
- Java/JSP/FreeMarker/Velocity; Node.js ejs/handlebars/pug engines
- Seek dynamic template resolution from user input (theme/lang/template)

### RFI Conditions

**Requirements**
- Remote includes (`allow_url_include`/`allow_url_fopen` in PHP)
- Custom fetchers that eval/execute retrieved content
- SSRF-to-exec bridges

**Protocol Handlers**
- http, https, ftp; language-specific stream handlers

**Exploitation**
- Host a minimal payload that proves code execution
- Prefer OAST beacons or deterministic output over heavy shells
- Chain with upload or log poisoning when remote includes are disabled

### Archive Extraction (Zip Slip)

- Files within archives containing `../` or absolute paths escape target extract directory
- Test multiple formats: zip/tar/tgz/7z
- Verify symlink handling and path canonicalization prior to write
- Impact: overwrite config/templates or drop webshells into served directories

## Testing Methodology

1. **Inventory file operations** - Downloads, previews, templates, logs, exports/imports, report engines, uploads, archive extractors
2. **Identify input joins** - Path joins (base + user), include/require/template loads, resource fetchers, archive extract destinations
3. **Probe normalization** - Separators, encodings, double-decodes, case, trailing dots/slashes
4. **Compare behaviors** - Web server vs application behavior
5. **Escalate** - From disclosure (read) to influence (write/extract/include), then to execution (wrapper/engine chains)

## Validation

1. Show a minimal traversal read proving out-of-root access (e.g., `/etc/hosts`) with a same-endpoint in-root control
2. For LFI, demonstrate inclusion of a benign local file or harmless wrapper output (`php://filter` base64 of index.php)
3. For RFI, prove remote fetch by OAST or controlled output; avoid destructive payloads
4. For Zip Slip, create an archive with `../` entries and show write outside target (e.g., marker file read back)
5. Provide before/after file paths, exact requests, and content hashes/lengths for reproducibility

## False Positives

- In-app virtual paths that do not map to filesystem; content comes from safe stores (DB/object storage)
- Canonicalized paths constrained to an allowlist/root after normalization
- Wrappers disabled and includes using constant templates only
- Archive extractors that sanitize paths and enforce destination directories

## Impact

- Sensitive configuration/source disclosure → credential and key compromise
- Code execution via inclusion of attacker-controlled content or overwritten templates
- Persistence via dropped files in served directories; lateral movement via revealed secrets
- Supply-chain impact when report/template engines execute attacker-influenced files

## Pro Tips

1. Compare content-length/ETag when content is masked; read small canonical files (hosts) to avoid noise
2. Test proxy/CDN and app separately; decoding/normalization order differs, especially for `%2f` and `%2e` encodings
3. For LFI, prefer `php://filter` base64 probes over destructive payloads; enumerate readable logs and sessions
4. Validate extraction code with synthetic archives; include symlinks and deep `../` chains
5. Use minimal PoCs and hard evidence (hashes, paths). Avoid noisy DoS against filesystems

## Summary

Eliminate user-controlled paths where possible. Otherwise, resolve to canonical paths and enforce allowlists, forbid remote schemes, and lock down interpreters and extractors. Normalize consistently at the boundary closest to IO.

_Thinking:_

 Good, I can see the FTP directory exists. Let me get a full listing and start testing path traversal to access sensitive files. I'll also explore the Complaint form and Photo Wall for file upload testing.

**Tool: bash**

**Input:**
```json
{
  "command": "curl -s http://juiceshop:3000/ftp/ | grep -oE 'href=\"[^\"]+\"' | sed 's/href=\"//;s/\"$//' | head -20",
  "description": "Extract files in FTP directory"
}
```

**Output:**
```
.
quarantine
acquisitions.md
announcement_encrypted.md
coupons_2013.md.bak
eastere.gg
encrypt.pyc
incident-support.kdbx
legal.md
package-lock.json.bak
package.json.bak
suspicious_errors.yml

```

**Tool: bash**

**Input:**
```json
{
  "command": "curl -s http://juiceshop:3000/ftp/quarantine/ | grep -oE 'href=\"[^\"]+\"' | sed 's/href=\"//;s/\"$//' 2>/dev/null",
  "description": "Extract files in quarantine folder"
}
```

**Output:**
```
./..
.
.
juicy_malware_linux_amd_64.url
juicy_malware_linux_arm_64.url
juicy_malware_macos_64.url
juicy_malware_windows_64.exe.url

```

**Tool: playwright_browser_click**

**Input:**
```json
{
  "element": "Open Sidenav",
  "ref": "e8"
}
```

**Output:**
```
### Error
Error: Ref e8 not found in the current page snapshot. Try capturing new snapshot.

_Thinking:_

 Interesting! The FTP directory has a restriction - "Only .md and .pdf files are allowed!" - but we can still download the KeePass file directly. Let me test more path traversal and file access vectors, and explore the application for upload surfaces. <|tool_calls_section_begin|> <|tool_call_begin|>     functions.bash:13 <|tool_call_argument_begin|> {"command": "curl -s http://juiceshop:3000/ftp/legal.md | head -30", "description": "Test allowed file type access"} <|tool_call_end|> <|tool_call_begin|>     functions.bash:14 <|tool_call_argument_begin|> {"command": "curl -s http://juiceshop:3000/ftp/../package.json 2>&1 | head -20", "description": "Test basic path traversal"} <|tool_call_end|> <|tool_call_begin|>     functions.bash:15 <|tool_call_argument_begin|> {"command": "curl -s \"http://juiceshop:3000/ftp/../../../etc/passwd\" 2>&1 | head -20", "description": "Test path traversal to /etc/passwd"} <|tool_call_end|> <|tool_call_begin|>     functions.playwright_browser_navigate:16 <|tool_call_argument_begin|> {"url": "http://juiceshop:3000/#/contact"} <|tool_call_end|> <|tool_calls_section_end|>
