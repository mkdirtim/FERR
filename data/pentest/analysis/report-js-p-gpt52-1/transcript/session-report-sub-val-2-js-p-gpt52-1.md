run_id: 8b64d1c2-d344-490d-89aa-649266b410e4

Validation shard: 2/3
Assigned proposal IDs (stable chunk):
- 7c311325-4a0c-4240-8851-759095d96d20
- be4325f1-2bd5-4cf9-b45f-25b1f1652b36

Instructions:
- First call pentest_get_proposals(run_id, status="proposed") and confirm these IDs are still proposed.
- Reproduce each proposal safely; capture confirming/denying evidence under /app/data/pentest/running/8b64d1c2-d344-490d-89aa-649266b410e4/evidence (absolute paths).
- Output <task_result> with: validated_ids, rejected_ids, evidence_paths, and brief reproduction notes per ID.
- Do not mutate proposal state directly.

_Thinking:_

**Collecting reproduction steps**

I need to focus on reproducing the vulnerability. I'll make sure to use Bash and check the relevant details. However, I'm not certain about the target specifics yet. The proposal record should provide clarity on the vulnerability type and the steps for reproduction. So, I’ll rely on the data from that record. Let's kick this off by looking into pentest_get_proposals to gather the necessary information.

**Tool: pentest_get_proposals**

**Input:**
```json

  "run_id": "8b64d1c2-d344-490d-89aa-649266b410e4",

_Thinking:_

**Troubleshooting ftp command**

I ran into a curl error (18) that indicated the end of the response was missing, but it still returned a large portion including the incident-support.kdbx. That's good for now. I need the file headers and xxd results, but since the error caused the script to stop, I’ll rerun the ftp listing with the `--fail-with-body` option. I want to ensure the command proceeds even if there’s an error, so I’ll avoid setting `-e` this time. Let’s execute this second bash call!

**Tool: bash**

**Input:**
```json
{
  "command": "set -u; echo '## ftp listing (allow partial)'; curl -sS -i --max-time 20 http://juiceshop:3000/ftp || true; echo; echo '## ftp incident-support.kdbx headers'; curl -sS -I --max-time 20 http://juiceshop:3000/ftp/incident-support.kdbx; echo; echo '## ftp incident-support.kdbx first 32 bytes (hex)'; curl -sS --max-time 20 --range 0-31 http://juiceshop:3000/ftp/incident-support.kdbx | xxd -p; echo",
  "description": "Fetch ftp listing and KDBX signature"
}
```

**Output:**
```
