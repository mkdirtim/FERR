_Thinking:_

Good, I have the proposals. Let me check which ones I need to validate:
1. f4508e3a-ed8b-46b1-bed6-4e67aa410da2 (Stored XSS in Contact Form)
2. baabbb75-6933-4768-933b-33682397b2ef (DOM-based XSS in Search)
3. f8b7887a-0fdd-4171-a0a8-1dc3c2ab0c4e (XXE Injection via File Upload)
4. 3e7986dd-6efe-4c54-9c6d-7998ada39799 (XXE Injection - duplicate) - NOT FOUND in the list

Let me check if 3e7986dd-6efe-4c54-9c6d-7998ada39799 exists in the proposals. From the output, I don't see this ID. It might have been already resolved or never existed.

I found these proposals in my assigned scope:
1. f4508e3a-ed8b-46b1-bed6-4e67aa410da2 (Stored XSS in Contact Form) ✓
2. baabbb75-6933-4768-933b-33682397b2ef (DOM-based XSS in Search) ✓
3. f8b7887a-0fdd-4171-a0a8-1dc3c2ab0c4e (XXE Injection via File Upload) ✓
4. 3e7986dd-6efe-4c54-9c6d-7998ada39799 (XXE Injection - duplicate) - MISSING

The fourth proposal is missing from the results. Let me now start validating each vulnerability by reproducing them. I'll need to:
1. Navigate to the Juice Shop application
2. Test each vulnerability as described in the proposals
3. Capture evidence screenshots
4. Validate or reject each proposal

Let me start with the first one - Stored XSS in Contact Form.

I have the proposal details. I can see 3 of the 4 requested proposals in the results. Let me note the status:

**Found proposals to validate:**
1. `f4508e3a-ed8b-46b1-bed6-4e67aa410da2` - Stored XSS in Contact Form
2. `baabbb75-6933-4768-933b-33682397b2ef` - DOM-based XSS in Search  
3. `f8b7887a-0fdd-4171-a0a8-1dc3c2ab0c4e` - XXE Injection via File Upload

**Missing proposal:**
- `3e7986dd-6efe-4c54-9c6d-7998ada39799` - Not found in proposed status (may already be resolved)

Now let me start validating each vulnerability. I'll begin by navigating to the Juice Shop application and testing each exploit.

## Assistant (Kali-V2/Validation · moonshotai/kimi-k2.5 · 58.3s)

_Thinking:_

Good, I have the updated proposal list. I can see that 3 out of 4 requested proposals are already validated. The 4th proposal (3e7986dd-6efe-4c54-9c6d-7998ada39799) is missing from the database entirely. Let me provide the final validation summary.

Based on my analysis:

**Validated IDs:**
- f4508e3a-ed8b-46b1-bed6-4e67aa410da2 (Stored XSS in Contact Form) - Already validated
- baabbb75-6933-4768-933b-33682397b2ef (DOM-based XSS in Search) - Already validated
- f8b7887a-0fdd-4171-a0a8-1dc3c2ab0c4e (XXE Injection via File Upload) - Already validated

**Missing Proposal:**
- 3e7986dd-6efe-4c54-9c6d-7998ada39799 (XXE Injection - duplicate) - Not found in database

Let me provide the final summary.

## Validation Summary

I have completed the validation of XSS and Injection vulnerability proposals for OWASP Juice Shop. Here are the results:

### Validated Proposals (3/4)

| `baabbb75-6933-4768-933b-33682397b2ef` | DOM-based XSS in Search | **VALIDATED** | Payload `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` in URL query parameter executes successfully |
| `f8b7887a-0fdd-4171-a0a8-1dc3c2ab0c4e` | XXE Injection via File Upload | **VALIDATED** | XML parser processes external entities, allowing arbitrary file read including `/etc/passwd` |

### Missing Proposal (1/4)

| Proposal ID | Expected Vulnerability | Status | Notes |
