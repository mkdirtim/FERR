## Assistant (Kali-V2/Validation · z-ai/glm-5 · 7.7s)

_Thinking:_

I need to validate a set of proposals for a penetration test run. Let me start by fetching all proposals for the given run_id to understand the scope and then process only the assigned proposal IDs.

Let me follow the workflow:
1. First, call `pentest_get_proposals(run_id)` to get all proposals
2. Then process only the assigned proposal IDs in sorted order
3. For each proposal, reproduce the vulnerability and validate or reject accordingly

I'll start by fetching all proposals for the run to understand the scope and then process the assigned proposal IDs.

_Thinking:_

Now I have all proposals. Let me identify the assigned proposal IDs and their status:

8. `7eaede85-e780-4e96-b303-cea0373ae6bf` - Sensitive File Access via FTP Directory Listing - status: proposed

All assigned IDs are found in the DB and all are in "proposed" status. Now I need to reproduce each vulnerability.

Let me start reproducing them. I'll use curl for HTTP-based repro first, as per the workflow.

Let me process them in sorted order:
1. `599f229a-2c49-4cf3-a343-c23dc9962000` - IDOR via User ID Parameter
2. `5e0039ea-1513-4550-891f-c4885db0251f` - Security Questions Enumeration

4. `5f9af9b3-5c07-4e36-9142-1286fdb27f86` - Premium Access Key Exposure
5. `62df8a62-c5d7-4103-947c-78a933c42e9a` - Security Questions Enumeration via Public API
6. `6a1c4a73-f0c2-4142-9b97-6643295ce34a` - Sensitive User Data Exposure via /rest/memories

8. `7eaede85-e780-4e96-b303-cea0373ae6bf` - Sensitive File Access via FTP

Let me start reproducing. I'll do several in parallel since many are simple HTTP GET requests.

Now I have all proposals. Let me identify the assigned IDs and their status:

_Thinking:_

Excellent! I've confirmed several vulnerabilities:

1. **Prometheus Metrics** (`5efe9488-6c50-4315-aa8c-34906f439883`) - VALIDATED - Metrics are exposed without authentication
2. **Sensitive Data via /rest/memories** (`6a1c4a73-f0c2-4142-9b97-6643295ce34a`) - VALIDATED - Password hashes, deluxe tokens, emails exposed
3. **Security Questions Enumeration via Public API** (`62df8a62-c5d7-4103-947c-78a933c42e9a`) - VALIDATED - All 14 security questions exposed
4. **FTP Directory Listing** (`7eaede85-e780-4e96-b303-cea0373ae6bf`) - VALIDATED - Directory listing enabled
5. **Premium Access Key Exposure** (`5f9af9b3-5c07-4e36-9142-1286fdb27f86`) - VALIDATED - Premium key exposed

Now I need to test:
- `5e0039ea-1513-4550-891f-c4885db0251f` - Security Questions Enumeration (includes email lookup)
- `599f229a-2c49-4cf3-a343-c23dc9962000` - IDOR via User ID Parameter
- `7655a8b0-6f76-4f65-aafe-12700f337a50` - IDOR - User Data Access via Users API

The last two require authentication. Let me first get a JWT token and then test the IDOR vulnerabilities.

Excellent! Several vulnerabilities confirmed. Now let me test the remaining ones that require authentication. I need to:
1. Test Security Questions email lookup

Great! Now I have:
1. Security question email lookup confirmed - admin's security question is revealed
2. JWT token for jim (a deluxe user, ID=2)
3. FTP file access confirmed - acquisitions.md is accessible

Now I need to test the IDOR vulnerabilities using jim's JWT token:
- `599f229a-2c49-4cf3-a343-c23dc9962000` - IDOR via User ID Parameter
- `7655a8b0-6f76-4f65-aafe-12700f337a50` - IDOR - User Data Access via Users API

Both proposals are about accessing user data via /api/Users/{id}. Let me test if jim can access admin's data (ID=1).

Now I have a JWT token for jim. Let me test the IDOR vulnerabilities:

**Tool: bash**

**Input:**
